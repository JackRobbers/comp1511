# operators

In groups: think of all the operators you've seen in C so far

--- 

| Type of Operator | Operators |
|---|---|
| Arithmetic | `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` |
| Logic | `&&` `\|\|` `!` |
| Comparison | `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `!=` `==` |
| Assignment | `=` |

also bitwise, increment/decrement, shortcut assignment operators but not necessary for 1511

# types

what have we seen so far?

how would you scan a value into these types with scanf?

---

| Type | format specifier | 
| -- | -- |
| `int` | `%d` |
| `char` | `%c` |
| `double` | `%lf` |
| `void` | N/A |

---

# expressions

"math / conventional" result (if it makes sense)?
result in C and what type does it have?

* `(7/2)`
* `(3.0 / 2) + 1`
* `'a' + 5`
* `'T' - 'A' + 'a'`

---

<!-- see expressions.c -->

| Expression | Math | C | C type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `(7/2)` | 3.5 | 3 | integer |
| `(3.0 / 2) + 1` | 2.5 | 2.5 | double |
| `'a' + 5` | N/A | 'f' | char |
| `'T' - 'A' + 'a'` | N/A | 'T' | char |

---

# procedures

allow you to reuse code, e.g

```c
void give_compliment(void) {
    printf("you are doing great!\n")
    printf("I really mean it")
}

int main(void) {
    give_compliment();
    printf("let me say it again\n")
    give_compliment();
}
```

# programming

* Scans in two integers (`a` and `b`).
* If the first integer is less than the second, prints out an error message.
* If the second integer is 0, prints out an short error message.
* If the first integer is larger than the second, prints `a / b` and `(a * 1.0) / b`.

how could we make this nicer with a procedure?
what would be better names for these variables than `a` and `b`?
