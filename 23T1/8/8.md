* malloc
* linked lists

---

# malloc

what would you write to malloc the following: 

* an `int`
* a `char`
* an `int` array of size 5

---

# malloc summary

* allocates memory that persists across function returns (unlike non malloc'd (stack) memory which is destroyed when the function ends)
* the parameter is how many bytes you want (sizeof is useful here!)
* since how much memory you get is dynamic, it's useful when you don't know how big something is when writing the program.
* returns a pointer to the memory

---

# linked lists

sequential data that must be accessed sequentially, allows for easier insertion and deletion than arrays.

---

# linked list activity

---

# live coding

insertion at the end (append)

# linked list tips / edge cases 

#### 3 positions to think about

* at the start
* in the middle
* at the end

#### 3 lengths of list to think about

* the empty list
* a list with 1 element
* a list with many (> 1) elements
